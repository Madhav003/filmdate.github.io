A hybrid of fiction and documentary, it brings reality and fantasy to discuss that which is the most important thing for some, and the least important thing for others: Love. Love is actually in every place and human activity we look at: art, business, advertising, sports, entertaining, religion, education, politics, etc. What is this thing that is so present in our lives? Why we are so desperate in having, possessing, idealizing or despising love? Everyone talks about it. Creates songs about it. Declares themselves to be loving human beings... What do they mean with all of this? \"Essay on love\" gives you a glimpse on this subject. On how people relates themselves to the concept of love, and as a film, is an attempt to approach this wonderful thing that love is, through cinema.",

And what can cities and regions do to attract the new economy?

He's the only player to start in four consecutive Final Fours, and was instrumental in Duke winning two national championships. He had looks, smarts and game. So why has Christian Laettner been disliked so intensely by so many for so long? Maybe it was the time he stomped on the chest of a downed player, or the battles he had with his teammates, or a perceived sense of entitlement. But sometimes, perception isn't reality. \"I Hate Christian Laettner\" will go beyond the polarizing persona to reveal the complete story behind this lightning rod of college basketball. Featuring extensive access to Laettner, previously unseen footage and perspectives from all sides, this film will be a \"gloves-off\" examination of the man who has been seen by many as the \"Blue Devil Himself.\"",

These two opposing sides are personified in the Partisan commander \u0160panac and a former Royal Army officer Radeki\u0107. \u0160panac sees Radeki\u0107 as the cause of villagers' resistance to the new, Communist, ideology and so the main plot axis is the conflict between them.  At the 1990 Pula Film Festival, the film won the Big Golden Arena for Best Film, as well as the awards for Best Actor in a Leading Role (Branislav Le\u010di\u0107), Best Film Score (Goran Bregovi\u0107). The film was also shown at the 1991 Moscow International Film Festival, where both Branislav Le\u010di\u0107 and Mustafa Nadarevi\u0107 won the Silver St. George Award for their performances.",

Marian is a journalist who has been working in Latin America and who arrives home just after her father dies to find out that the man she had married for purely political reasons might be deported because the authorities found out he was not living with her. Meanwhile, Marian is upset that her mother and sister are keeping her mentally handicapped brother in an institution, and she goes there to get him released into her custody -- a mistake it turns out. He is actually worse off with her, and vice-versa. On top of everything, Marian cannot break away from the depression she feels over a tragic incident that happened while she was in Latin America -- and anything she does is colored by that moment from the past. These burdens become almost too much to bear, both for Marian and the viewers.",

It shows how they experience an education overburdened with social and historical background. It catches their moments of laughter and happiness, their struggles against setbacks that they do not always understand, their thoughts about issues that arise both in their own and in the adult world. It is a film that makes everyone laugh, but the naivety of the children is always shown from their own perspective. Deep insights are embedded in the seemingly light-hearted scenes and not only about childhood. For the film is also a metaphor for the adult world. As the opening line of the film says: \"They are our children, but maybe they are us ourselves.\"",

Shocking and challenging, these were works in which Jesus didn't die, took revenge on his enemies and kissed Mary Magdalene on the mouth - a Jesus unrecognisable from that found in the traditional books of the New Testament.  Through these lost Gospels, Pete reconstructs the intense intellectual and political struggles for orthodoxy that was fought in the early centuries of Christianity, a battle involving different Christian sects, each convinced that their gospels were true and sacred.  Owen Jones sets out the context in which heretical texts like the Gospel of Mary emerged. He also strikes a cautionary note - if these lost gospels had been allowed to flourish, Christianity may well have faced an uncertain future, or perhaps not survived at all.",

Writing from across thousands of miles, Poushkin reached out to Pouschin and his other former classmates. \"May God help you, my friends /In times of storm and grief /In far off lands, in empty seas /And in the somber caverns of the earth.\" The historian Nathan Eidelman brilliantly describes the lives and friendship of these remarkable men.

I chose outlines and color for Temple , for simplicity but also because I only had two hands and could not modify everything at once.",

He returned a year later to lie with his camera on the spot where she died, and to roam the neighbourhood searching for footage. As remarkable as the girl\u2019s sudden death was, the young filmmaker also found it devastatingly normal. He\u2019d, \"already seen it, thousands of times.\" '18,000 Dead in Gordon Head' is a treatise on the omnipresence of violence in contemporary culture, even (or some would say especially) in the banal context of a Canadian suburb. Composed as a poem, the final work is a hybrid of several film stocks and video formats, processed to create a kinetic, lyrical collage of textures, loops, rhythms and visual rhymes, and in the end finally completing the work\u2019s cycle back to its originally intended film format.",
