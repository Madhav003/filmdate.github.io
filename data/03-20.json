The peasants fiercely resist the government's decision. Milisa Matic is a peasant who fights against the establishment of peasant cooperatives because in that case many peasants would lose their newly acquired land. The Communist government has decreed the founding of cooperatives and Markan Radisic is in charge of their establishment. When Markan's son proposes to Milisa's daughter, the two men confront each other. In self-defense Markan kills Milisa, however the national court fails to find mitigating circumstances. On the way to prison he listens to the news on radio about the abolition of agricultural cooperatives.",

Upon receiving the news about the risk to her life, L\u00facia, laconic, tells the doctor: 'Then open it'. This is the second time she has undergone bypass surgery. From this gesture, the documentary Abry was born (with y, sign of the unconscious, according to the nomenclature invented by his son, Glauber Rocha). To relate her memories, she invites filmmaker Joel Pizzini, who offers his mini camera as an instrument to amplify L\u00facia's imagination. Abry is a poetic dive into L\u00facia Rocha's fabulous universe, reconstructing her trajectory in Brazilian cinema through sounds, images and characters with whom she lived closely.",

The most visceral of these prints a rotating boulder, occupying half of the screen, over a slow lateral pan across the desert (painted by Neon Park). A faint superimposition of leaves on top of the landscape has the effect of pushing its vista farther back in space. Correspondingly, the boulder bulges out of the picture-plane like a Cezanne apple. The effect is so strong that even when O'Neill begins to animate 'scratches' over the image, one's eye refuses to surrender the illusion of volume.\" - J. Hoberman, The Village Voice",
