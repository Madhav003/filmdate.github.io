Madoka and Hikaru have grown up to become a promising songwriter and a student of drama and dance, respectively; the older Kyosuke is a student-photographer on assignment in Bosnia. The problem of two Kyosukes coexisting is played for laughs, including a sequence where the 22-year-old Kyosuke counsels his younger self. The filmmakers expect the viewer to know the characters from the OAVs, although designs have been changed. The result is a Pax-style romantic fantasy, rather than a sci-fi adventure.",
