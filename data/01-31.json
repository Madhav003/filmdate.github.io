Snow is vital to the balance of mountain ecosystems. Many animal and plant species at high altitudes depend on it for their survival. But due to global warming, snow is falling less and less. Will there be no more snow in the future? In the Alps and eastern US the situation is clear: as temperatures rise, snow falls less and less, and snow periods tend to shorten. This threatens the mountain flora and fauna. What future do the marmots or alpine bells have without a heat-insulating layer of snow? What future do the marmots or alpine bells have without a heat-insulating layer of snow? What will happen to the conifers in North America without the annual frost protection? Research teams are looking at the implications for snow-adapted species. The documentation shows animal mountain dwellers, who hope for the long-awaited snow every winter.",

Journalist Martha Kearney delves into the biographies of both Carroll himself and of the young girl, Alice Liddell, who inspired his most famous creation. She discusses the book with a range of experts, biographers and distinguished cultural figures - from actor Richard E Grant to children's author Philip Pullman - and explores with them the mystery of how a retiring, buttoned-up and meticulous mathematics don, who spent almost his entire life within the cloistered confines of Christ Church Oxford, was able to capture the world of childhood in such a captivating way.",

The case was one of the first that shined a spotlight on what many called the \"legal lynchings\" that occurred in the South whenever blacks were accused of crimes, especially against whites and most especially against white women.",

Weaving together this story with extracts from many of Shakespeare\u2019s most famous plays, Simon Callow presents a vivid and very human portrait of the man and of the Elizabethan world in which he lived.  Recorded before an audience during the play\u2019s triumphant London run, Being Shakespeare is both a wonderful introduction to the author and a richly nuanced, funny and fascinating study for those who already love his plays.",

Several years later, however, she receives news that makes her start carting away the dune, bucket load by bucket load. It turns out her boyfriend is alive, and that hes been living in Cape Town for the past six years. He ran off because he made a local girl pregnant a pregnancy attributed to the local schoolmaster. As the villagers watch Klara move the dune, they begin examining their own lives, and the entire community undergoes a wondrous rejuvenation.",

Unfortunately, this is not possible as Dax confides in Blaze one evening and their father overhears, turning them in the very next morning. Naomi, Blaze's beautifully spirited, completely human girlfriend, gets exiled with them as well (guilty by association). They must fend for themselves in a desert full of loose zombies and questionably abandoned government experimentation labs, for if Blaze and Dax do not find some raw meat to consume quickly, their urges to devour Naomi may cause them to lose control of their mutation.",

Vienna State Opera succeeded in recruiting Marco Arturo Marelli a man with a world-wide reputation, especially for global premieres as director and scenographer for this performance. Unusually for a world premiere, the first series of performances of the opera were a huge success amongst audiences and press alike.

The DVD is a trim package with only nine videos in roughly 40 minutes, yet it excels as a document of thoughtful visual poetry, an evolving symbiotic relationship, and a convenient condensation of the group's achievements over the past decade [upon release]. In other words, Bareback can be appreciated for its visual and aural qualities, both independent of and in combination with each other.",

Using Bergdahl's poem as a template, Donegan creates a structured visual language that leans as much on formal rules as it does on content. In Donegan's silent collage of seemingly disparate images culled from Internet searches and home video footage, each new clip directly corresponds to a word in the original Bergdahl poem; the apparent stream of consciousness is governed by a rigorous set of rules.",

Creator of some of the world's great artistic masterpieces, such as the Last Supper and the Mona Lisa, he was also a visionary whose fantastic inventions would become reality only hundreds of years after his death. Follow the original Renaissance man through glittering palaces of merchant princes, accusations of blasphemy, and whispers of betrayal and romance--all to satisfy a limitless desire for knowledge. From the producers of Islam: Empire of Faith and Barbarians, and available on DVD for the first time ever, DA VINCI AND THE CODE HE LIVED BY tells the remarkable story of one man's boundless talent, his towering legacy, and his courage in the face of powerful adversity.",

The directorial debut of actor Anatoly Vasiliev, who also stars, the film tells the seemingly simple story of a man returning to his native village to purchase a house, only to find himself caught between the worlds of the living and the dead. Drawing on deep wells of Sakha spirituality and folk symbolism, and cast with local, non-professional actors, Summer House is a rarely-seen gem of independent filmmaking and a key piece of Sakha film history.",

Everything, everywhere is the slogan of the nineties, a confusion of bodies, concepts and strategies, a kind of out of joint situation for the subject. And we find ourselves in all the media, in all the bodies in all the possible spaces at ones, but this deadly dance is not innocent. The video consists of the main part in which wives of the so-called totalitarian leaders as of the Rumanian dictator Cauceuscu (Elena) and of the former Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic (Mirjana Milosevic) are forced to dance. Focused on the portrait of Mirjana Milosevic (The story of Mirjana M.) a kitsch melodramatic Balkan saga of power, drama, pop-folk elements and evil/demons is constructed. The apathy of feelings is caught in the dramatic tango that is slowed down for the camera eye.",

    "overview": "Pornfilm is a short film about love and sex. About the narratives of each. A woman reads a brief story about an actor's real life marriages; failure and later, wedded bliss. The reading is stiff, awkward and stumbling. The images are of two actors having sex; awkward, stumbling and with an investigatory band ping ponging back and forth, an incessant watching and exposing which ends in song.",
