But when Dan finds himself kicked out of the family home, he's faced with no option but to secretly move into the call centre where he works.

As Dan's work/life balance spirals dangerously out of control, he's forced to break out of old habits and to dare to do something he has never had to do before - really care about someone other than himself.

Hibari takes on the role of Mori no Ishimatsu, a young man who gets involved with real-life Yakuza legend, Shimizu no Jirocho, 'Boss of the Tokaido'. Ishimatsu manages to interfere with a dispute between the Shimizu and their competition, the Marugame family, even going so far as to become an avenger's assistant.  It's not the first time Hibari has played a man in a film (also in Benten Kozo), and her acting skills are at their best as she mixes in a bit of humor along with excellent swordplay.  Wakayama Tomisaburo, as always, gives an outstanding performance as the powerful and beloved Yakuza Boss Jirocho.",

Equal parts human drama and speed, \"APEX\" follows Swedish entrepreneur Christian von Koenigsegg, a lifelong sports car enthusiast on a personal quest to build a \"mega\" car whose golden ratio defies all expectations for a hypercar's velocity and power, while competing against the biggest names in motorsports for space on the world stage. With insights from top engineers and designers, \"APEX\" pulls back the curtain on the top-secret development facilities at Porsche, Ferrari, McLaren and Pagani, where awe-inspiring hypercars are imagined and built, and puts you inches from the action, as top drivers shake down the latest hypercars, flat-out on some of the world's greatest racetracks.",

The dismantling of the old Royal Hospital to transform it into a luxury hotel fills the streets of Santiago de Compostela with the sick, perpetual pilgrims and the poor. It happens that the night is black, like the future, like the hearts of men, like the country, and it becomes long, very long. Thus, a night of peaceful wandering turns into a mad race for survival of two strangers, friends in pain, who, unable to change the world, no matter how hard they try, struggle, at least, and with all their strength, to see it again tomorrow.",

This shorter work, seemingly assembled from leftover footage from the longer film, continues the story of the circus owner Leni Peickert  after she first abandoned her idea of a radical circus in favor of a job in television. It opens where the previous film left off, at a TV station where Leni and her friends have gathered as employees, attempting to infiltrate the corporate establishment with their own revolutionary ideas. This radicalism is somewhat undercut by the way that Kluge deliberately shoots down the low-cut blouse of one of these young revolutionaries, the camera eyeing her cleavage and then panning down, to the text she's reading, and then back up again, finding her sexuality ultimately much more interesting than her radicalism.",

The music, the atmosphere, the faces give us a few indications that nevertheless remain very vague.

Glimpsed on music videos by Usher, Missy Elliot, and Christina Aguilera, this is a truly original way of moving the body that is completely innovative and breathtakingly expressive. Developed on the streets, it portrays all the emotion of kids growing up in poor communities plagued by drugs, violence, and hopelessness, as well as the sheer joy of movement and of life itself. Resembling a martial art in its athleticism, krump dancers move faster than most viewers would have thought possible. This documentary presents the opportunity to explore this hot new craze that's here to stay, featuring some of the best dancers and choreographers on the scene, including Roland Tabor, Dave Scott, and Shane Sparks.",
