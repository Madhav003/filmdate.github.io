    "overview": "Pauline Kael (1919\u20132001) was undoubtedly one of the greatest names in film criticism. A Californian native, she wrote her first review in 1953 and joined \u2018The New Yorker\u2019 in 1968. Praised for her highly opinionated and feisty writing style and criticised for her subjective and sometimes ruthless reviews, Kael\u2019s writing was refreshingly and intensely rooted in her experience of watching a film as a member of the audience. Loved and hated in equal measure \u2013 loved by other critics for whom she was immensely influential, and hated by filmmakers whose films she trashed - Kael destroyed films that have since become classics such as The Sound of Music and raved about others such as Bonnie and Clyde. She was also aware of the perennial difficulties for women working in the movies and in film criticism, and fiercely fought sexism, both in her reviews and in her media appearances.",

Meanwhile, an emergency physician finds out why flu is still such a danger a century after flu killed up to 100mi people. He meets researchers trying to discover what makes some people more contagious and visits a factory that will produce vaccine when the next pandemic flu virus emerges.  Armed with the information he gathers and the results of the BBC Four Pandemic experiment, they make a shocking revelation.",

The coed, racially diverse crowd of roughly 100 people at Benjiy\u2019s that night included club regulars, bar staff, and potential players in Empire State. Every single detail captured in Jarman\u2019s on-location assignment abounds with era-specific riches: from the New Romantic cutie journaling while nestled in a corner booth to the DJ\u2019s cheerful exhortations and the songs he spins (\u201cLet the Music Play,\u201d \u201cPlanet Rock,\u201d \u201cRelax\").",

Power structures are translated into a sporting struggle with an open output, in which the roles of domination and submission are reversed from one moment to the next. Shot primarily in slow motion, the competitive nature of the jiu-jitsu fighters and racehorses is paralysed by an extreme aestheticization, transforming scenes of action into objects of contemplation and visual pleasure.",

This historical action drama, based on the book Sous le vent de galerne by Andre Guilloteau looks at some of the less well-known and unappealing consequences of the republican takeover. In 1793, the entire region of Vendee rose up in revolt against the republican French government. Instead of bringing relief from the heavy taxation imposed under the monarchy, the republican government actually raised taxes in the region, and to add insult to injury, also imposed a heavy burden of military conscription (\"the draft\") on it. In the story, the inhabitants of one of the villages of the region organize under their blacksmith and a local nobleman to fight the government forces, but before they can prepare for a proper battle, they are massacred.",

    "overview": "There are more than 320 thousand migrant workers legally hired in Taiwan, among them more than half are from Thailand. To these migrant workers, working abroad in Taiwan is a risky gamble. If they win, they can pay back large amount of brokerage fee and earn some money to support their families. The three Thai workers from northeastern Thailand in this film, however, weren't so lucky. The electronic factory that they'd been working was suddenly closed down. The owner of the factory simply said that he could not afford to pay the salaries of the 100 domestic workers and 100 migrant workers. The Thai workers were eventually deported back to Thailand after fighting futilely for their rights with other migrant and domestic workers. Their dreams of earning money were totally shattered. Some of them were deeply in debt. Would they give up their hopes in earning money from working abroad because of their bad experiences in Taiwan?",

After the depenalization of homosexuality, only one of the deported men from France had the courage to go public about an extradition that even now is not officially recognised. Alternating excerpts from Pierre Seel's autobiography \"Moi Pierre Seel, d\u00e9port\u00e9 homosexuel\" and conversations with militant gays, \"Amants des hommes\" seeks to shed light on a forgotten history, linking the past with the present and yesterday's homophobia with that of today.",
