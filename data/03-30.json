The one who amazed and kept us entertained until the very end, and whose sole purpose in life was to make people laugh. Living life to the fullest, he went from one memorable film role to the other. But behind the upbeat, frenzied facade of Robin Williams was a sensitive and vulnerable man, deeply plagued by depression and haunted by his demons. Few comedians have ever been as beloved as Robin Williams. His story is full of tragic moments. It inspires us to look past the mask of those people who seem to have a perfect life. His legacy, reaching way beyond his body of work, lives on. We look back at the journey and tragic loss of a unique comic legend...and one of the greatest comedians of all time.",

The local chief of police savagely beat him, leaving him unconscious and permanently blind. The shocking incident made national headlines and, when the police chief was acquitted by an all-white jury, the blatant injustice would change the course of American history. Based on Richard Gergel\u2019s book Unexampled Courage, the film details how the crime led to the racial awakening of President Harry Truman, who desegregated federal offices and the military two years later. The event also ultimately set the stage for the Supreme Court\u2019s landmark 1954 Brown v. Board of Education decision, which finally outlawed segregation in public schools and jumpstarted the modern civil rights movement.",

    "overview": "In an era where \u201cPG\u201d rated wrestling rules, it\u2019s easy to forget about the late 90s and a wrestling product on television that featured irreverent, vulgar, and sexual themes. As today\u2019s fan seems far less passionate about WWE offerings, perhaps what they need is a jumpstart with some of yesteryear\u2019s themes. A product with \u201cattitude.\u201d  This edition of Guest Booker features former OVW booker and current TNA creative member, Al Snow. Snow was right in the mix during the edgy attitude era, reminding audiences what \u201ceverybody wanted.\u201d  So how would he define the \u201cattitude era\u201d and just what separates that from today\u2019s product? We figured we\u2019d ask the always opinionated former booker that exact question.  Snow tackles all that and so much more as we once again explore the lost art of booking with one of the creative minds of the business. Get ready to spend some time exploring the most controversial era in the sport with our Guest Booker\u2026Al Snow",

For the thousands of fans who travel to the Isle of Man each year it is a pilgrimage to the shrine of motorcycling. This documentary captures the spirit and character that surrounds the festival through the eyes of those involved in it. Through director Andy Stickland\u2019s candid approach, the real TT is seen on film for perhaps the first time. It reveals the emotions, fears and thrills throughout the fortnight that go hand-in-hand with the excitement of the racing. It offers an all-access pass to the pit lane tensions, and gives an angle to the TT that is seldom, if ever, seen by the spectator.",

On the monitors, random fragments of natural phenomena, such as fire and pounding surf, were set in opposition to more domestic scenes of deterioration, centering on a farmhouse in ruins. A further exploration of the space revealed these elements, as subtly engaged in a systemic and coherent exchange between order and disorder, harmony and imbalance.",
