And as if all this wasn\u2019t bad enough, their relationships to their wives are falling apart. \u2018Eat Bitter\u2019 mirrors the existential and mundane problems of the two men, while an unlikely friendship and mutual trust blossoms between them. However, the chaotic microcosm of the construction site also mirrors China\u2019s contradictory role in 21st century Africa, with the bank itself as the ultimate symbol of money, power and illusion. Director duo Pascale Appora-Gnekindy and Ningyi Sun themselves represent each of the two cultures, and their film has a unique eye for the human fallibility and irony of it all, but also for how we can reach each other despite all our many differences.",

    "overview": "Simon Yam Tat-wah and Rosamund Kwan Chi-lam star in this gauzy melodrama about the life and loves of the gangster elite, directed by Andy Chin Wing-keung. The film centers around Ching Kit, a mob boss who instead of using typical tools of underworld shakedowns -- mob hits, blackmail, and the like -- employs the dinner party to negotiate deals, to forge partnerships, and craft revenge. When Ching works out a deal with the Portuguese mob that would give him partial control of Macau's casinos, he quickly learns that treachery lurks around every corner. Veronica Yip Yuk-hing, Cecila Yip Tung, and Pauline Wong Siu-fung also appear.",

In a film marked by unparalleled access, Christoffer Guldbrandsen captures the tumultuous final months of the Trump administration, centering on the heart of power and climaxing with the unprecedented storming of Congress.  Guldbrandsen finds himself amidst the chaos as Trump supporters converge on Washington, witnessing firsthand Roger Stone's strategic retreat from his hotel suite as the 'Stop the Steal' campaign spirals into a riot. A Storm Foretold \u2013 Roger Stone and Die unfolds the narrative of a once-established political party metamorphosing into an anti-democratic movement, where impassioned rhetoric evolves into tangible violence.",

The film unveils the personal lives of Adolf Hitler, Benito Mussolini, Joseph Stalin, Francisco Franco and Mao Tse Tung. We learn the private and mundane details of their everyday lives -- their favorite foods, films, habits and sexual preferences. There is no mention of their public lives or of their place in history. The intentional omission of the horrors for which these men were responsible hovers over the film.",

The first part of the work consists of a two-channel video, and the second part a single channel.  The work stages the dramatic encounter of the fraught friendship between an artist and a censor, as well as the creeping tension in their exchanges. Together and in reversing roles, they ask fundamental and existential questions about the arts, testifying to the uncertainties they share about the purpose of art in society: what is the role of an artist in an authoritarian state? How could art bring about social change?",

But as meditations upon nature, isolation, decadence, and destitution, they are flawless conduits for seamless blends of documentary and narrative form, and stunning explorations of sound, image, and cinematic time. Mysterious and elusive, yet possessing an aesthetic and sensory unity (appearances by Denis Lavant, Aurore Cl\u00e9ment, and Dianna Molzan mix with direct addresses from real-life laborers and inmates), GRAY HOUSE quietly recalibrates one\u2019s sense of the world and our place within it.",

But edited thirty years later with St\u00e9phane G\u00e9rard, they are also a tribute to Herv\u00e9 Couergou, the beloved partner at the center of all the filmed scenes. Slowly, in conversations between couples and friends, the dandy spirit and intimate confession overlap. What emerges is a portrait of a way of dealing with the times and their pain, which, beneath the act of commemoration, seeks to inscribe a living presence.",

As it plays out the possibilities and tests the competing theories, it endeavors to get to the bottom, once and for all, of what really happened to the princes in the Tower. Is this a tale of naked ambition, cold pragmatism and bloody murder?",

Unpleasant flashbacks to Marina's tragic childhood ensue. Yep, the good times never end in this one! Known in English as Portraits in a Sea of Lies, this meditation on the 50-year long Colombian civil war - as seen through the grueling experiences of our heroine - won the Jury Award for Best Narrative Feature at the 14th Cine Las Americas International Film Festival.",

In her ice hockey team, which Karl coaches, she easily outplays her male teammates with the odd body check. But everything changes when editor-in-chief Sonja moves in next door and Karl unceremoniously turns the two apartments into a shared flat following an accident. Sonja observes the father-daughter relationship between Karl and Nic and interferes in their upbringing, especially when she realizes that Nic would also like to be a woman and that not everything revolves around ice hockey.",

Reliable, versatile and readily available, the Avro Lancaster's arrival in 1942 made way for a new calibre of the four-engined bomber that would become Bomber Command's primary weapon during the Second World War. Participating in some of the most daring and famous missions of the day, the Lancaster marked a momentous period in British aviation history, and has maintained an iconic status ever since.  Using original wartime footage and recent colour film of one of the few operational Lancaster's remaining in the world, this programme relays a full and fascinating account of the Lancaster's story, which will prove both informative and highly dramatic.",
