Fantastic thought experiments are visualized: animals grow many times their normal size and a man is shrunk to the size of an insect. The results of the unnatural reversal of size ratios have incredible consequences. What are the advantages and disadvantages? \"Size matters\" is a scientific documentary narrated with fictional scenes. Parallel worlds are created in which size appears in a completely new light, often in a different way than previously known. Modern, astonishing CGI sequences support internationally recognized scientists on a journey to both ends of the size scale and help to understand the world in its dimensions.",

They are evicted from their home and her case-Vera versus the city-finds its way to a young, ambitious lawyer. She doesn't know the world of the Romani, nor is she particularly interested in it.

Luckily she is not the only one who sides with the family. There is a social worker whose attempts to help the Horv\u00e1ths are also motivated by his entirely private interest in the attractive lawyer.",

While it was in existence, the Carandiru was the largest prison in Latin America, administered by a reduced number of employees. The documentary shows, from the point of view of these few employees, holding the keys, how the prison operated: the delicate balance in the relationship with the prisoners, affinity among employees, moments of tension and, even, of happiness. These are stories told by former employees, among them, Dr. Dr\u00e1uzio Varella, author of the book Esta\u00e7\u00e3o Carandiru. These are the secrets of a place that no longer exists.",

    "title": "David Lama - Off Limits On Rock and Ice",
    "release_date": "2014-03-17",
    "overview": "The Tyrolean David Lama has climbed an 8a route already at the age of ten, and he has become several times Youth World Champion and European Youth Champion in bouldering and lead climbing. In 2010, at the age of 20 years, David decided to leave the indoor climbing and competition world behind him. Since then, he is focusing on Alpinism, the most difficult routes and first ascents in the Alps, but as well in India and America. This documentary portrays David Lama from his first climbing attempts as a little boy to his big adventures in present time. We see famous locations, such as the climbing paradise on Lake Garda, the notorious Sagwand Face in the Zillertal Alps, and the 7.821m high Masherbrum in the Karakorum with its still untouched north east face.",

But the question is: will you be listening? You might be too busy watching in amazement as a four metre White Shark \u2013 weighing 1\u00bd tons \u2013 cruises the big blue with a diver clutching her dorsal fin. Every spare synapse will be used up as the same diver gently wrestles a Tiger shark into catatonia, its oven-wide head and tooth-riddled jaw inches from his face. You will be too busy gawping as Caribbean Reef and Black Tip sharks cuddle in the lap of Gansbaai free diver Mike Rutzen, also known as South Africa's \"shark whisperer\"...\" (excerpt from a press article by Steve Pike, about the film commissioned by Animal Planet and Discovery Channel to, acclaimed Cape Town filmmakers, the Foster Brothers).",

On the back of his own memories he depicts the rough world of the dockworkers, another of those trades that has undergone fundamental changes as a result of recessions, modernisation and liberalisation. \u201cThe visual impression of the harbour and the city has changed very little, but what goes on there nowadays is completely different. The city is still as beautiful and alien and somewhat sad as before. But the port is dying, like so many other major ports. In Genoa, as elsewhere in Italy, the economic, social and political climate is highly explosive. But you also feel that things are in flow and the country is on the verge of some far-reaching changes. (...) In this film I wanted to explore my own memories of Genoa, uncover its present and guess at its future. Genoa, this beautiful, this sad, this alien town has become for me a metaphor for society in change.\u201d",

It was titled \"Thunder Meets Lightning\" as an allusion to the punching power of Ch\u00e1vez and fast handspeed of Taylor. The fight was expected to be a rousing and exciting one but few, if any, could have foreseen the intense action it would produce, or the lasting fame it would earn in boxing history due to its dramatic and controversial ending that continues to be widely debated to this day. It would later be named The Ring magazine's Fight of the Year for 1990, and later the \"Fight of the Decade\" for the 1990s.",

The film has a sketchy, literally \u201cexperimental\u201d feel to it. A search connects the film to the legacy of abstract graphic works made at CalArts, as it was shown in a fifteen-program retrospective of CalArts films at the Centre Pompidou in 2007. After CalArts, Luttrell started the company Cynosure Films which did optical effects for films like Stranger Than Paradise and Down by Law. -Herb Shellenberger",

For years there was a huge effort to discredit her evidence, but now in an exclusive interview, the policeman at the centre of her investigation has finally broken his silence. He claims that his enquiry was blocked - because it threatened to reveal too much.",
