Around Cape Horn, a Mystic Seaport video released in 1984, chronicles that voyage on the Peking.  Seven of Johnson's round-the-world voyages aboard the brigantine Yankee are charted and illustrated with National Geographic's striking footage of exotic stops in the South Pacific islands. Later, aboard the smaller ketch Yankee, we travel with the Johnsons through the inland waterways of Europe and up the ancient Nile.  Captain Johnson's realistic yet openly optimistic view of life is captured, showing him to be a paragon of the sailor. Several members of the \"family\" crew recount how memorable it was to sail with the Johnsons, and relate their appreciation for the experience.",

We follow the daily routines of the employees at the station's shops, the caf\u00e9, and the ticket office, the bus drivers and cabbies, the homeless and the drifters, the permanent visitors and the passersby, to discover a sporadic community in its vain, but persistent efforts at patching up the gaps of a worn-out system.",

Secondly,the making of this film will always remain a miracle of sorts for Ren\u00e9 F\u00e9ret as no big production house was willing to finance such a brave,absolutely uncommon film in France.So this film was finally made due to Ren\u00e9 F\u00e9ret's personal intervention and highly individual efforts. Its visual style was applauded by a great French filmmaker named Bertrand Tavernier who has long been one of Ren\u00e9 F\u00e9ret's admirers.",
