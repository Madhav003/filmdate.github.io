Jim, forced to live up to his end of the deal, is nearly laughed off the try-out field--until he gets onto the mound, where he confounds the scouts (and himself) by clocking successive 98 mph fastballs, good enough for a minor-league contract with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. Jim's still got a lot of pitches to throw before he makes it to The Show, but with his big-league dreams revived, there's no telling where he could go.",

Babette conceives of herself as an abbess defending her fortress, a convent; Michelle is transported in a dream of love where all time ceases; Philippe is the revolutionary, defeating all the institutions that plague him, and so on, through all their fantasies. All the actual preoccupations of youth are raised: authority, drugs, social conflict, sex. Jutra's style in \"Wow\" exhibits his innovative approach to storytelling and filmmaking, showcasing his talents as a director during that period. With English subtitles.",

    "overview": "The girl asked, \"Where is Manga Island?\" Only manga artists can set foot on the island. Idle people are not allowed to enter, but Manga Island is also like a besieged city. People outside want to enter, while those inside want to come out. A few manga artists trapped on a small island, accompanied by snakes and insects, perform the horror of a deserted island, and even rush to draft day and night, pouring their emotions and desires onto paper. When it comes to brain block, I finally come up with the legend of mermaid monster Tan and dungboat, and I'm afraid of being taken by someone. Everyone was hungry, afraid of both starvation and exhaustion of inspiration. Struggling with the barren environment, but also entangled with one's own demons. Shouwu Wenxiong initially made a long film, wrote and acted by himself, cleverly transforming the desire, pain, confusion, and joy of creation into a fantasy drift of a group of cartoonists.",

Because of its varied and current themes of racism, love, jealousy and betrayal, Othello is still often performed in professional and community theaters alike and has been the basis for numerous operatic, film and literary adaptations.",

As she undergoes surgeries on a body decimated by cancer, remembrance and reconstruction provide a framework for investigating how bodies are traumatised, censored and politicized, and yet ultimately remain a site of possibility.",

Shot in Tibet, the short introduces us to a community that lives among Yaks, large ruminant mammals.  Chantal Jolis, a judge of the competition, said of the film: \"What I felt there was a farewell to something essential, at the same time as a testament to the race.\" Villeneuve ulitmately won that year's edition of La Course Destination Monde.  Notably, the film features the track \"Trip to Arrakis\" by TOTO, composed for David Lynch's 1984 adaptation of Frank Herbert's DUNE.

The fact remains that I had to leave the south for Lille, in the North, where my grandmother Yaya (her true name is Alice but this is the way call her) and my grandfather Georges were living. What I disliked most was that Yaya had a preference for Michel and that Granddaddy was too grumpy. In Lille I also got very upset when pupils at the catholic school I attended told me I was... Jewish. Jewish? I didn't even know that Jews even existed. And when I knew better about them (Michel was more informed than I was), what a shock it was when I learned that my two other grandparents had been sent to a concentration during the war. A little too much for a little girl like me. A sure thing is that I will never forget the year 1952, the year when I was seven...",

Crooked guards? Bribe them. Corrupt administrators? Blackmail. And when all else fails, find an outside ally with inside connections to stage an escape. But when conflicting schemes overlap and collide, everything goes up in flames and it's the inmates who will burn. One third of the way into her sentence for the possession of illegal drugs, Reika, prisoner number 48, discovers that she's up for parole. Better yet, she's gathered enough dirty laundry on the warden and his cronies that she might be able to walk free, but only as long as nothing upsets the delicate status quo. Too bad that a former lover is setting up a jailbreak at the same time, and now the ultimate fate of Reika, Saya and the other inmates hangs on the outcome.",

After one of Doder's gang is arrested in a botched burglary attempt, Tobey is framed. In the dramatic and exciting climax, Tobey must prove his innocence to Suzy and the whole school by facing reality and confronting Jim Doder in public.",

The ability to travel back in time in your mind is, perhaps, your most remarkable ability, and develops over your lifespan. Horizon takes viewers on an extraordinary journey into the human memory. From the woman who is having her most traumatic memories wiped by a pill, to the man with no memory, this film reveals how these remarkable human stories are transforming our understanding of this unique human ability. The findings reveal the startling truth that everyone is little more than their own memory.",

In his last months Jonny decided to work with filmmaker Patrick Collerton to document his life and death, and the result was a film, first broadcast in March, that was an uplifting, confounding and provocatively humorous story of a singular man. Not shying away from the grim reality of EB, the film was also a celebration of a life lived to the full.",

    "overview": "In this clever satire of toxic men, a cartoon pickup artist is violently torn apart by the women he targets, seen only through his own one-sided, ridiculously misogynistic point of view.  Don Hertzfeldt's first student film, he plays the part of a mentally unwell animator who's losing his grip within his own movie; an idea he'd later revisit in other early \"meta\" shorts \"Genre\" and \"Rejected\".  Despite being produced at the age of 18 and not intended for exhibition, HBO named it \"The World's Funniest Cartoon\" in 1998.",

The episode intercuts footage from Eye of the Storm with new footage of the students, who are now adults. The film takes us through the journey of a young class learning the unfairness of racism. Elliot teaches the lesson through eye color and different treatment. All of the students admit that this is wrong. In footage of the students as adults, we are able to see how this shaped the experiment changed their lives.",

Christian is without any resources, inner or outer, and caters to Catherine's every whim, even when she sends him out in the middle of their wedding reception to score some heroin for her. Their wedding is the starting point for their relentless downward spiral into the most brutally senseless lives imaginable, in this stylishly filmed exploration of the dark netherworld of the human spirit.",

A preternatural luck seems to take them everywhere in space and in time with infinite energy. Yet as their various world travels were most likely filmed on the same sound stage, they are like-wise emblems of a flimsy utopia. In this void, there is no sound, or rather, the original sound of the all-female band is replaced by a techno beat that uncannily seems to have belonged there all along, punctuating the regulated paroxysms of ultimate global unity--promised in the image but deferred through the never-resolving beat.",

This gave him an opportunity to try new techniques and to develop his own instrumental style. The six Brandenburg Concertos belongs to these masterpieces for a small ensemble.  This joyously infectious performance of these famous landmarks in the history of music by the Freiburg Baroque Orchestra demonstrates both the musical satisfaction and the high professional standard that can be reached with period instruments. The performance was given in the Bach Anniversary Year 2000 \u2013 250 years after his death \u2013 in the elegant Hall of Mirrors at Coethen Castle.",

You can also get a quick suntan or wallow in a Jacuzzi at Sundance City, buy the latest casual wear at Le Pel men's boutique, or sip a \"slow comfortable screw up against the wall' in the Dun Cow Champagne Bar. These establishments live happily side by side with Bert's Eel and Pie Shop, the Fishing Tackle Specialists, and the world-famous Thomas a Beckett gym. This film looks beyond some of the shopfronts you'd normally pass down the A2 and reveals a host of unexpected personalities, mostly two-legged but above all Bermondsey born and bred.",

We hope that through the film, people can understand more about bisexuals.",
