This project bloomed during an art residency in Iceland, sparked by conversations around our shared philosophies on voice and emotional connection. The nature of Iceland inspired us to make the connection on how the landscape reflects the emotional states of creativity and how it helps manage the homeostasis of our inner emotional landscapes. This exchange between emotion and the landscape opens a space for healing. Creativity provides us with the tools to access a garden of our authentic being, nourishing and balancing us. Allowing ourselves to explore the spectrum of our emotions through the lens of our relationship with the Earth invites others to do the same. The creative process can affect our well being and is a key to human evolution.",

But of that number, nearly half were Sherpas - the mountain's unsung heroes. Yet the Sherpa community has remained secretive about their nation, culture and experiences living in the shadow of the world's highest mountain. Now, for the first time, they open the door into their world.  Without the expertise of the Sherpas, only the hardiest and most skilful climbers would succeed. Every day they risk their lives for the safety of others, yet they seek neither glory nor reward, preferring to stay in the background. Following the stories of four such Sherpas - Phurba, Ngima, Ngima Tenji and Gelu - this film reveals the reality of their daily lives, not just up the mountain, but with their families after they return home.",

In the documentary essay LA PETITE MORT, women of different ages and with different sexual preferences share how they experience orgasms, describe what it feels like and open up about a failed climax. Removed from pornography and excessive eroticism, they open up in indirect conversation with director-narrator Annie Gisler, who illustrates the sensual narratives of her protagonists with poetic, abstract and metaphorical images. Driven by the desire to overcome taboos and expectations that still overshadow female sexuality, the young Swiss filmmaker provides a sensitive and humorous examination of feminine intimacy in all its multifaceted richness. A dialogue among women, for women. And men.",

Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov, who became famous and infamous under the name Lenin, wanted to overthrow the monarchy, modernize Russia and spread socialism across the globe. Under Lenin's leadership, the Russian Social Democratic Workers' Party seized power in the Russian October Revolution of 1917.

Yasser Arafat was an incredibly controversial figure- labeled by some as a corrupt terrorist whilst idolized by others as a revolutionary hero. Regardless of people's own opinions, his importance as an international leader cannot be disputed. The film is built around revealing interviews with the people who knew Arafat best; his comrades, confidants, and even his adversaries. The filmmakers also gained exclusive access to Yasser Arafat's widow, Suha, who provides a frank and highly emotional insight into the life that Arafat lived and the sacrifices he made for the Palestinian cause.",

It is a cinematic parallel to Donner's New Book of Our Land (1967). The travelogue focuses especially on Finland's outsiders, low-paid workers and the unemployed. In desolate provinces, the inhabitants of a cold and barren country either humbly abide their fate, choose to move to Sweden or take refuge in excessive drinking. These images are accompanied by protest songs based on Donner's own prose and the lyrics of poet Jarkko Laine. Perkele is embodied in big business and the political elite.The jagged (anti)aesthetics of the film correspond to the underground movement and the radical politics of the time. The camera agilely penetrates everyday life. Though opposed to censorship, Fuck Off! itself transgresses the boundaries of privacy.",

Catharina Roland explores this crucial question, inviting us to share in her deeply enriching journey to discover how we can be whole again, how we can heal ourselves and the environment we live in, and how we can leave the cocoons of our perception to face our own selfishness and fears.  Through lessons from visionaries and spiritual teachers as well as numerous exercises, Awake in the Dream gives us the tools to break down the walls of the person we have created for ourselves. Complete the transformation from caterpillar to butterfly. Tap into the potential that has existed since the beginning of time, and wake up to the wholeness that awaits each and every one of us.",

The boy, rather than seeing his situation clearly, continues to spout learned platitudes, including the incredible observation, \"the earth is round,\" supported by nothing other than his authority as an \"educated man.\" Understandably, his posturing provokes derision.",

They were even more disgruntled when they realized how the coup was being manipulated by leftist officers to instigate genuine elections and establish a constitution for the first time in Portuguese history. Though their intent was to form a radical socialist state, circumstances prevented this, and a genuine parliamentary democracy emerged. This film explores the circumstances of a right-wing businessman during those times. The man is an old-fashioned authoritarian, whose attentiveness to the needs of his mistress, wife and son is crude where it exists at all.",

With Malthouse Theatre director Marion Potts, composer Iain Grandage (Optimism), the Wild Dog Orchestra and the ever-dexterous Mitchell Butel (Woyzeck), Meow and her cohorts ignite a fantastical flight of musical fancy with dark, cut throat comedy and a whiplash score.",

Subverting state-sponsored informational films on such issues as war bonds and highway safety, Plays transforms these agit-prop rhetorics into a celluloid mirror of transgression as a larger cultural pathology. In Zero Hour, the results - the products of war return to the initial cite of production: an assumed audience of Americans, middle-class citizens of an ideal suburban dream who have somehow foregone the immediate experiences and repercussion of mass destruction and displacement. The gaze rests on us. We are the sugar-stated, hyper and unaware violator, an audience whose relationship to world events is nowhere more homogeneous than in or communal incubation and guilt.",

    "overview": "I first started by taking a black 16mm film leader and holding a magnifying glass above the film. I then used the sunlight to burn each frame in the film leader. At the same time that I was burning the film leader, I was also filming the process of burning each frame. After developing the film, I then physically burned each frame with a soldiering iron in the exact same area that it was burned by the sunlight. The result was that when projected, one would see the filming of the burn at the same time one sees a single frame action of the physical burning of the film, followed by other concepts dealing with 24 frames. 24 frames make one second and this gives the illusion of smoothness. However, because each frame was burned, it gives an animated impression together with the smoothness of 24 frames.",

In Kaliyugaya the young couple have aged, their children are scattered, and their past is recalled in flashbacks from the former movie. Since the kali yuga is the worst of four Hindu time periods and we are in it now, the title implies that suffering is bound to arise in the 83-minutes of the movie. Although unhappiness is not a principal theme, the mother (Punya Hendenlya) does grapple with her feelings when she gets a letter from her son in London that accuses her and her husband (Henry Jayasena) of serious faults -- and she starts to go back over the past, recalling incidents that might help her to understand why her son has turned against them.",

The GRASS digital system combined with the IP formed the digital visual instrument used in the performance. Spiral 5 was performed in front of a studio audience and the music was re-recorded later. It is an abstract, mathematical animation based on the linear spiral, in something you might call the visual music tradition.",

The first dozen or so seconds of the etude are actually an abstract film. Thick liquids of various colors spread on a smooth surface. Over time, the frame is increasingly filled with regular geometric patterns, short shots of machine details, first close-up shots of fragments of shoes, and after a while shots of Wellington boots in full view on a single-color background. At the end of the film, still photographs showing women's legs in Wellington boots are also incorporated into its structure. Finally, we see models wearing autumn coats and colorful Stomil Wellington boots. The closing sequence of the film consists of a pulsating company logo interspersed with shots of legs in Wellington boots. Their image was multiplied by dividing the screen into small squares.",
