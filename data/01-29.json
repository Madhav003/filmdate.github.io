But Nora, whose sister died in the terrorist attacks of September 11, refuses to be as cold and dispassionate as Ben. It takes a series of near-death experiences dodging bullets and fanatical rebels for Ben and Nora to find the common ground so necessary to their future teamwork.",

These lectures on \u201cwhat is cinema\u201d and \u201ccooking as an art form\u201d are frequently illuminated by presentation of archaeological artefacts from Kubelka\u2019s eclectic collection. He considers his ongoing collecting to be an expanded film practice which explores the evolution of humanity.\u2028 Martina Kudl\u00e1\u010dek has carefully woven an open-ended portrait which goes beyond the biographical to reveal fresh insights into the phenomenon of film.",

Scenes chronicling Howard\u2019s doomed romance with Scandinavian girl friend Turid Aarsted are interwoven with scenes detailing Howard\u2019s relationship with his parents and with a former girl friend, as well as his failed attempts at moviemaking. One sequence depicts Aarsted leaving the thirty-seven-year-old Howard for the film\u2019s cameraman, Paul Goldsmith, and includes a sex scene between the new lovers. In off-screen commentary, producer Kenneth E. Schwartz expresses concern about the film\u2019s content. He reveals that he raised $50,000 for the project, complains to the viewer that the film was not supposed to be a \u201cdiary of freaky people.\u201d Eventually he and Howard come to terms about the film\u2019s direction and allow the film\u2019s story to unfold unobstructed.",
